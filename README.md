To use this simulation, set the parameters in the .m file to the nominal conditions of your rocket's flight. 
For Monte Carlo, enable it with the true/false statement at the top of the Monte Carlo section. You can change the parameters of the Monte Carlo Simulation to have a higher/lower deviation of flight characteristics.
